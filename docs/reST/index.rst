Welcome to Cubic Interpolation's documentation!
===============================================

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    axis
    splines
    interpolant


The aim of the `C++` written library is to interpolate functions to get an accurate
and fast description of resource intensive calculations with an reasonable mistake.
The interpolation tables will be saved and reused if an savepath will be specified.
Axis and function value transformation are possibile and highly recommented to
minimize the interpolation failure.
